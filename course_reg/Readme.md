WHAT AM I:
I am a python script to check availability of a course periodically and send email and sms if there is a course.
SOme of the course in Georgia tech are overcrowded, so we need to know as soon as some one drops it so we can go ahead and register it. Hence I created this script to inform as soon as there is availability for a particular course.
