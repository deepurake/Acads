1) Issue: In the plot “Top 10 Customers in the Pipeline”, It is difficult to read the graph since the the customers are in Y-axis.
Instead the graph can be inverse with X-Axis being the customers revenue, while y axis being the revenue in dollars.

2) Too much information in pipeline and trends
Some redundant info can be deleted

3) Probability bars is unclear, no description or Axes 
we need x and Y axes to represent the data. Also we can make probability Y axes to make it more readable. 

4) Redundant info in Revenue targets, Target% and Poor % have same values.
They cane deleted and for the first table, we can delete the table and represent it as values for whole table.

5) The chart database in targets and Revenue targets is not right way to represent numbers since we don’t get feel of comparison. 
Bar charts would be a good alternative.
